<h2>📌 Project Overview</h2>
<p>
    For my Web Development 1 course, I created an educational website about one of my favorite animals—the Axolotl! 
    This amphibian is not only fascinating but also critically endangered, making it an important subject to highlight. 
    The project’s primary goal was to learn and implement HTML & CSS fundamentals, focusing on structure, styling, and responsive design.
